In 2020, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector carbon footprint was estimated to be between **2.1-3.9% of total global greenhouse gas emissions**. The ICT sector [continues to grow and now dominates other industries](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data). It is estimated that the **carbon footprint will double to 6-8% by 2025**. For ICT sector to remain compliant with the Paris Agreement, the industry must reduce by 45% its GHG emissions from 2020 to 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 ([Freitag et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100340)).

AI is one of the fastest growing sectors, disrupting many other industries ([AI Market Size Report, 2022](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/artificial-intelligence-ai-market)). It therefore has an important role to play in reducing carbon footprint. The impacts of ICT, and therefore AI, are **not limited to GHG emissions and electricity consumption**. We need to take into account **all major impacts** (abiotic resource depletion, primary energy consumption, water usage, etc.) using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) ([Arushanyan et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2013.10.003)).

**AI sobriety not only means optimizing energy consumption and reducing impacts**, but also includes studies on **[indirect impacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_effect_(conservation)#Direct_and_indirect_effects)** and **[rebound effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)** that can negate all efforts to reduce the environmental footprint ([Willenbacher et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-88063-7_5)). It is therefore imperative to consider the use of AI before launching a project in order to avoid indirect impacts and rebound effects later on.
